          The EIFK is a portable hydroponic system that allows any user to
          easily and nutritiously grow their own food. Our kit uses a simplistic
          system of tubes to constantly circulates water to allow the system to
          water the plants on its own. Our system also lets the user know if the
          plants are dehydrated and need more water. Our product produces fresh,
          healthy, and organic vegetables. The only way you truly know if your
          food is organic is if you grow it yourself. Most stores use pesticides
          on their plants which can make them harmful and unhealthy to the user.
          Since our kit is used inside, it does not need harmful sprays, so our
          produce remain healthy. Our product is affordable and we are a
          non-profit organization. Half of our profit helps us keep our product
          cost low and the other half goes to places that can't afford our
          product. The EIFK comes with a rechargeble battery powered motor, just
          add water. Our system also provides a low LED light during the night
          to keep your plants healthy and growing.

        Mission Statement:
      </h1>
      <p class="coolor">

        access to nutritious food for all. We want to provide the common man
        with a way to be nutritious and healthy that make's it simple. Our
        target is America, but our hope is to spread worldwide with the help of

      <h2 class="center headSize">What is Hydroponics?</h2>
      <p class="coolor">
        Hydroponics is a way growing plants without soil. All you need is water,
        sand and nutrients for the plant. You can grow a variety of plants,
        which makes this cheap and easy.
      </p>

      <p class="coolor">
        You don't need to constantly add water. The system we've created
        constantly circulates the water througout the plants. This system allows
        plants to grow all year long. It also allows it to grow indoors. An
        added bonus, growing indoors gets rid of pests. You can also show our
        app a picture of the plants to show you if it is dehydrated and needs
        more water.

          Levon James: When I got sick with COVID, I never had the time to get
          grocceries. I was working two jobs but could barely afford the rent.
          My son was always hungry. Then I got the EIFK. My grocery bill has
          been cut down by 80%. I've even been able to sell my extra produce.
          I'm very grateful for the EIFK.
